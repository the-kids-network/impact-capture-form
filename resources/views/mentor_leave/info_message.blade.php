    Please make sure that you have informed your mentee, their parent / caregiver and TKN about your time away.

        data-content="We encourage you to make up the sessions before and after going away by having additional sessions.<br/><br/>
Itâ€™s nice to include your mentee in your time off. If you are going away, send them a postcard or try the food of that country when you get back.<br/><br/>
You could also think about setting a goal before you go e.g. both doing five jumping jacks each morning.">
